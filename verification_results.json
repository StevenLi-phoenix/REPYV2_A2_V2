  "way9227_attackcase11": "Correct: True\nReason: The test aligns with the spec\u2019s intent: it verifies that creating a new version while the latest version is open is disallowed. It sets up v0, then runs two threads where one opens the latest version (creating v1) and keeps it open while the other attempts to create another new version (v2). Success in creating v2 would be a bug and triggers a log; failure (raising an exception) is treated as correct and produces no output. The test does not rely on error messages, catches exceptions to suppress expected errors, and does not perform any disallowed operations (no deletions, no explicit version creation, no writes to older versions). Under a correct monitor, no output is produced.\n\nTimeline:\n1. Main (sequential):\n   - openfile(\"threaded\", True) \u2192 Creates v0.\n   - writeat(\"INITIAL\", 0) on v0.\n   - close v0.\n   - Prepare shared flag result = {\"created_when_open\": False}.\n2. Main starts threads (parallel region begins):\n   - slow thread:\n     - openfile(\"threaded\", True) \u2192 Since v0 exists and is closed, creates v1 and opens it.\n     - writeat(\"Slow\", 0) on v1.\n     - sleep(0.5) keeping v1 open.\n     - close v1.\n   - fast thread:\n     - sleep(0.05).\n     - openfile(\"threaded\", True) \u2192 Attempts to create v2 while v1 is still open; per spec, this must be disallowed (should raise FileInUseError).\n     - On exception, sets result[\"created_when_open\"] = False. If it (incorrectly) succeeds, closes and sets result[\"created_when_open\"] = True.\n3. Main (no join): Immediately checks result; since default is False and a correct monitor raises an error on the fast open, no log is produced.\n\nSpec Violations: None",
  "wjl9629_attackcase2": "Correct: False\nReason: The test is not aligned with the spec. It attempts to create/open explicit version paths with create=True, which the spec forbids and must raise RepyArgumentError. The test then treats any exception as a failure and raises ValueError, violating the requirement to catch and suppress expected errors and to produce no output. Additionally, it implicitly assumes that version names with leading zeros (e.g., \".v01\") are valid aliases for existing versions, which is not supported by the naming rule that uses str(num) (no leading zeros).\n\nTimeline:\n1. Initialize: base_test = \"testfile.v\", end_number = \"1\".\n2. Loop num_zeroes = 1..29 (sequential):\n   - Construct filename = \"testfile.v\" + \"0\"*num_zeroes + \"1\" (e.g., \"testfile.v01\", \"testfile.v001\", ...).\n   - Call openfile(filename, True):\n     - Per Section C: openfile(filename + \".v\" + num, create=True) must raise RepyArgumentError(\"Cannot create explicit version files\"). No file is created.\n   - except: catches the raised exception and immediately raises ValueError(filename), producing output and failing the test.\n3. The loop does not progress past the first iteration under a correct monitor because ValueError is raised.\n\nSpec Violations:\n1. Section C: openfile(filename + '.v' + num, create) \u2014 If create=True \u2192 raise RepyArgumentError. Test violates by expecting success:\n   - Code: f = openfile(filename, True) where filename is like \"testfile.v01\".\n2. Section G: Tests may check for expected errors but must catch and suppress them; no output. Test raises instead:\n   - Code: except: raise ValueError(filename)\n3. Section B/C naming semantics: Versions are named with str(num) (no leading zeros). The test assumes \u201c.v01\u201d, \u201c.v001\u201d, etc., are valid version identifiers, which they are not; they will never exist and cannot be created explicitly. \n   - Code context: filename = base_test + '0'*num_zeroes + end_number and subsequent openfile with create=True.\n\n"
