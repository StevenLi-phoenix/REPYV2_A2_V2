## Previous Update - Advanced Sorting & Cleaner Matrix View

### New Features

#### 1. Test Sorting
- âœ… Sort tests by **Most Failed** - identify problematic tests across all monitors
- âœ… Sort tests by **Most Passed** - see which tests are easiest
- âœ… Sort tests by **Most Timeouts** - find tests with timeout issues
- âœ… Sort tests by **Name** - alphabetical ordering
- Test columns reorder dynamically based on sorting

#### 2. Cleaner Matrix Layout
- âœ… Removed Pass/Fail/Timeout/Total columns from table
- âœ… Stats moved to hover tooltips on Monitor NetID
- âœ… More space for the actual test matrix
- âœ… Cleaner, less cluttered view

#### 3. Enhanced Hover System
- **Hover over Monitor NetID**: See pass/fail/timeout/total stats
- **Hover over Test Headers**: See how many monitors passed/failed that test
- **Hover over Result Cells**: See execution details (duration, error, output)
- Three levels of information, all accessible via hover

#### 4. Independent Sorting
- Sort monitors by pass/fail/timeout counts
- Sort tests by pass/fail/timeout counts
- Both sortings work independently and simultaneously
- Order control (ascending/descending) applies to active sort

### UI Improvements
- 5-column control layout for better organization
- Separate "Sort Monitors By" and "Sort Tests By" dropdowns
- Legend updated with hover instructions

python3 run_all_tests.py

# Start web visualizer
python3 web.py

# Open browser
# http://localhost:8000
```

### Data Files Generated

1. `submit/result/test_results_matrix.csv` - Summary matrix (PASS/FAIL/TIMEOUT)
2. `submit/result/test_execution_logs.json` - Detailed execution logs with metadata
3. `submit/result/failed/*.r2py` - Failed test cases
4. `submit/result/success/*.r2py` - Successful monitors

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Overview**: See all results at once
- **Quick Analysis**: Hover to investigate failures
