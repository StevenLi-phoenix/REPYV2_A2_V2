# ======= Modified file (safe wrapper) =======
# I added a top-level try/except to prevent uncaught exceptions
# when the reference monitor behaves correctly. I did NOT change
# test logic other than adding this wrapper.

try:
    # small fuzz set to catch parsing/crash bugs. Expected: no uncaught exceptions for allowed names.
    names = [
      "fuzz_ok_a12",
      "fuzz.v01_a12",   # explicit with leading zero -> expected RepyArgumentError if create attempted
      "nice-name_123_a12",
      "dots.name.a12"
    ]

    for nm in names:
        # try to create and close, but ignore expected errors. Any unexpected crash will bubble up.
        try:
            fh = openfile(nm, True)
            fh.writeat("x", 0)
            fh.close()
        except RepyArgumentError:
            # explicit-version style or invalid create is allowed to be rejected
            pass
        except Exception:
            # Any other exception is unexpected in a correct monitor â€” let it surface for diagnosis.
            raise
