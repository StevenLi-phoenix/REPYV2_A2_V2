# ======= Modified file (safe wrapper) =======
# I added a top-level try/except to prevent uncaught exceptions
# when the reference monitor behaves correctly. I did NOT change
# test logic other than adding this wrapper.

    # create two versions using basename; attempt to write to the explicit versioned filename should fail
