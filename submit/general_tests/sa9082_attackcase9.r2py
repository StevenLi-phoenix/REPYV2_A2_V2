# Test 9: Can we open a non-existent version file?
# Purpose: Test if monitor raises FileNotFoundError for non-existent versions
# Expected: Should raise FileNotFoundError

# Step 1: Try to open a version file that doesn't exist
# Using create=False should raise FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist
try:
    # Attempt to open non-existent version file
    f = openfile("testfile9.txt.v99", False)

    # If we reach here, opened non-existent file - FLAW!
    log("FLAW FOUND: Opened non-existent version file!\n")

    # Clean up
    f.close()

except Exception:
    pass
