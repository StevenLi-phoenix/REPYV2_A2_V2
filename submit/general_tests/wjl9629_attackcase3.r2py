# Test Specification 1 and 5:
    # "All operations must behave identically to RepyV2 (without your security layer) except as mentioned below."
    # "Versioned files can be accessed using openfile(originalfilename + '.v' + str(num), create), where num starts from 1."
# How it tests: it tries to make a file that isn't versioned and sees if an error is thrown (it shouldn't)
