  Attack Case 3: Monitor Failed

ORIGINAL TEST DESCRIPTION:
  Name: anf3003_attackcase3.r2py
  Attack Case: File create -> remove -> recreate race condition. In this test, 
               we create a base file with "Old Content", then use threads to 
               continuously remove and recreate the file with "Malicious Content", 
               attempting to trick a monitoring thread into reading the malicious 
               content.
