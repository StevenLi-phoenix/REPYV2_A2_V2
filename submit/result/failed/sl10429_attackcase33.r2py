ORIGINAL TEST DESCRIPTION:
  Name: anf3003_attackcase1.r2py
  Attack Case: File creation race condition. In this test, we attempt to first 
               open a base file and write "Original Content", then use threads 
               to simultaneously overwrite the specific file with "Malicious 
               Content", breaking immutability.
