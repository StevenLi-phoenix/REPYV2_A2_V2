# Test Annotation System

## Overview
The web visualizer now includes a comprehensive annotation system to track test resolution status and mark invalid tests.

## Features

### 1. **Mark Failed Tests as Resolved**
- **Color**: Blue with checkmark (‚úì)
- **Use Case**: When you've fixed the issue causing a test to fail
- **Action**: Click on a failed (red) test cell ‚Üí Click "Mark Resolved"
- **Effect**: Turns blue, indicating the issue has been addressed

### 2. **Mark Failed Tests as TODO**
- **Color**: Orange with pin icon (üìå)
- **Use Case**: When you know about the failure and plan to fix it later
- **Action**: Click on a failed (red) test cell ‚Üí Click "Mark TODO"
- **Effect**: Turns orange, indicating it's on your to-do list

### 3. **Mark Entire Test as Invalid**
- **Color**: Yellow with warning icon (‚ö†)
- **Use Case**: When the test itself is incorrect or doesn't align with specs
- **Action**: Click any cell for that test ‚Üí Click "Mark Entire Test as Invalid" ‚Üí Provide reason
- **Effect**: 
  - **ALL monitors** for that test turn yellow
  - Applies to all PASS/FAIL results
  - Reason is stored and displayed
- **Important**: This marks the TEST as invalid, not individual monitor+test combinations

## Color Legend

| Color | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| üü¢ Green | ‚úì | Test passed |
| üî¥ Red | ‚úó | Test failed (needs attention) |
| üîµ Blue | ‚è± or ‚úì | Timeout (expected) OR Test failed but marked as resolved |
| üü† Orange | üìå (with ring) | Test failed and marked as TODO |
| üü° Yellow | ‚ö† | Invalid test (applies to all monitors) |

## How It Works

### Data Storage
- Annotations are stored in `test_annotations.json`
- Structure:
```json
{
  "resolved": {
    "sl00000|aa11931_attackcase15": true
  },
  "todo": {
    "sl00000|aa12037_attackcase14": true
  },
  "invalid_tests": {
    "ac12757_attackcase9": "Test violates Section G by producing unexpected output"
  }
}
```

### State Management
- **Resolved** and **TODO** are mutually exclusive
  - Marking as resolved removes TODO status
  - Marking as TODO removes resolved status
- **Invalid test** overrides PASS/FAIL colors
  - All cells for that test show yellow regardless of pass/fail status

### API Endpoints

#### Mark Resolved
```bash
POST /api/mark_resolved
{
  "netid": "sl00000",
  "test_name": "aa11931_attackcase15",
  "resolved": true
}
```

#### Mark TODO
```bash
POST /api/mark_todo
{
  "netid": "sl00000",
  "test_name": "aa12037_attackcase14",
  "todo": true
}
```

#### Mark Invalid Test
```bash
POST /api/mark_invalid_test
{
  "test_name": "ac12757_attackcase9",
  "invalid": true,
  "reason": "Test violates Section G by producing unexpected output"
}
```

#### Get All Annotations
```bash
GET /api/annotations
```

## Workflow Example

### Scenario 1: Fixing Failed Tests
1. Run tests ‚Üí See red cells for failures
2. Investigate and fix the issue in your monitor
3. Click the red cell ‚Üí "Mark Resolved" ‚Üí Turns blue
4. Re-run tests to confirm the fix works

### Scenario 2: Prioritizing Work
1. Review all failed tests (red cells)
2. For urgent issues: Mark as TODO (turns orange)
3. Work through orange cells systematically
4. Mark as resolved when complete (turns blue)

### Scenario 3: Invalid Test Cases
1. Discover a test that doesn't follow specifications
2. Click any cell for that test
3. "Mark Entire Test as Invalid" ‚Üí Provide reason
4. All cells for that test turn yellow across all monitors
5. Document the issue for the test author

## Benefits

1. **Visual Progress Tracking**: See at a glance which issues have been addressed
2. **Prioritization**: Mark TODO items to focus your efforts
3. **Test Quality**: Identify and flag invalid tests
4. **Team Collaboration**: Share annotation file to sync status across team
5. **Audit Trail**: Reasons for invalid tests are documented

## Integration with ChatGPT Verification

When ChatGPT verification results are available:
- Verification comments help identify invalid tests
- Use "Mark as Invalid" for tests flagged by ChatGPT as incorrect
- Document ChatGPT's reasoning in the invalid test reason

## File Management

### Backup
```bash
cp test_annotations.json test_annotations.backup.json
```

### Share with Team
```bash
git add test_annotations.json
git commit -m "Update test annotations"
git push
```

### Reset All Annotations
```bash
rm test_annotations.json
# Restart web server to create fresh file
```

## Tips

1. **Use Invalid Test Sparingly**: Only for tests that are genuinely incorrect
2. **Provide Detailed Reasons**: Help others understand why a test is invalid
3. **Review Regularly**: Check resolved items after re-running tests
4. **Document Patterns**: If multiple tests are invalid for the same reason, note it

## Troubleshooting

### Annotations Not Saving
- Check file permissions on `test_annotations.json`
- Ensure web server has write access to the directory

### Colors Not Updating
- Refresh the page after marking items
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Invalid Test Not Affecting All Monitors
- Verify you're using "Mark Entire Test as Invalid" (not resolved/TODO)
- Check that the test name matches exactly
